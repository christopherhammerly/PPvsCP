<b>Instructions</b>
</p>


<p>
After you have finished reading each sentence, you'll be asked to judge if the sentence <b>you just read</b> is an acceptable sentence of English using a scale from 1-7, where 1 is the least acceptable sentence and 7 is the most acceptable sentence, and 4 is somehwere in the middle. Respond using the number keys, and make sure to use every number available in the scale, even if it feels forced at first. It will begin to feel more natural over the course of the task. 
</p>
<p>
You are NOT being asked to judge the plausibility of the sentence; you are simply being asked to judge whether each sentence sounds like a possible sentence of English. You are also not being asked to judge whether each sentence is acceptable according to a 'school grammar.' As a native speaker of English, you have intuitions or 'gut feelings' about what sounds like an acceptable sentence.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes you may not be sure which answer is correct. When this happens, go with your first instinct, don't over think it! 
</p>
<p>
Throughout the experiment, you should always keep your hands positioned so that the thumb on one hand is pressing the spacebar, and the other hand is selecting a number valuing using the number keys. Remember, please try to press the spacebar fast enough to allow for relatively natural reading of the sentence.
